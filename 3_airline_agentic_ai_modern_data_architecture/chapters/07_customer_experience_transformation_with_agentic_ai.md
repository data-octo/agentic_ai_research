### Journey Challenges in Traditional Approaches

Despite decades of investment in customer experience, airlines face persistent challenges:

#### Fragmentation
The journey spans multiple systems, departments, and partners:
- Reservations managed by commercial systems
- Airport experience controlled by airport authorities and ground handlers
- In-flight experience delivered by cabin crew with limited customer context
- Post-travel engagement managed by marketing teams
- Service recovery handled by customer relations departments

This fragmentation creates inconsistent experiences, with passengers frequently needing to repeat information or experiencing disconnected service across touchpoints.

#### Limited Personalization
Traditional approaches to personalization suffer from:
- Rigid tier-based treatment based primarily on loyalty status
- Limited use of preference and history data across touchpoints
- Generic service recovery protocols regardless of customer value
- Personalization data trapped in channel-specific silos
- Inability to adapt in real-time to changing circumstances

#### Reactive Service Model
Airlines typically operate in a reactive rather than proactive mode:
- Waiting for customers to report problems rather than anticipating needs
- Addressing disruptions after they impact customers
- Responding to service failures rather than preventing them
- Communicating after decisions are made rather than during deliberation
- Offering standard compensation rather than personalized recovery

#### Resource Constraints
Human resource limitations create service challenges:
- Staffing fluctuations impact service consistency
- High-volume touchpoints limit personalized attention
- Complex situations overwhelm front-line staff capabilities
- Training limitations affect service quality and consistency
- Information overload hinders effective decision-making
