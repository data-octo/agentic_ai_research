    class CRS,DCS,FOS,MRO legacy
    class RMS,CRM,ERP,BI established
    class ECOM,MOB,DATA modern
    class API,CLOUD emerging
```

#### Legacy Core Systems
The oldest layer consists of mission-critical systems designed in the mainframe era:
- Passenger Service Systems (PSS) handling reservations and inventory
- Departure Control Systems (DCS) managing check-in and boarding
- Flight Operations Systems controlling aircraft movement
- Crew Management Systems handling pilot and cabin crew schedules

These systems were built for reliability and transaction processing rather than data sharing or analytics. Many use proprietary technologies, legacy programming languages, and closed architectures that make data extraction challenging.

#### Specialized Operational Systems
The middle layer consists of specialized systems that address specific operational needs:
- Revenue Management Systems optimizing pricing and inventory
- Maintenance Planning and Control managing aircraft technical status
- Ground Operations Systems coordinating airport activities
- Catering and Logistics managing in-flight service supply chain

These systems often operate as isolated applications with their own databases and data models, communicating with other systems through point-to-point interfaces or manual processes.

- Different systems may use different codes or identifiers for the same entity
- Data entry errors and inconsistent processes affect data quality
- Timing differences between systems create reconciliation challenges
- Multiple sources of truth exist for key data elements

#### Limited Real-Time Capabilities
Many legacy systems were designed for batch processing rather than real-time data access:
- Flight operational data may be updated only at specific intervals
- Customer information may not be synchronized across touchpoints
- Inventory and availability may have latency across distribution channels
- Analytics typically work with historical snapshots rather than current state

#### Integration Complexity
The point-to-point integration architecture common in airlines creates challenges:
- Hundreds or thousands of individual interfaces between systems
- Multiple data transformation and translation points
- Brittle dependencies that break with system changes
- High maintenance cost for integration infrastructure
