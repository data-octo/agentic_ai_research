    D --> E[Model Deployment]
    E --> F[Model Monitoring]
    F --> G[Model Retraining]
    G --> C
    end
```

#### Components
1. **Development Environment**: Jupyter notebooks, IDEs, and version control systems provide a collaborative space for data scientists and engineers to develop AI models.
2. **Training Infrastructure**: GPU clusters and distributed training platforms enable the efficient training of complex AI models. Experiment tracking tools help monitor and compare model performance.
3. **Deployment Platform**: Model serving frameworks, A/B testing tools, and performance monitoring systems ensure that AI models are deployed effectively and deliver consistent results.

## 5.4 Security Architecture

### 5.4.1 Security Framework
```mermaid

    Identity & Access
      Authentication
      Authorization
      Role Management
      Access Control
    Data Protection

      WAF
    Compliance
      Audit
      Reporting
      Monitoring
      Controls
```

A robust security framework is essential for protecting sensitive data and ensuring compliance with regulations. Key components include:
- **Identity & Access**: Authentication, authorization, and role management ensure that only authorized users can access systems and data.
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, masking, and key management safeguard data at rest and in transit.
- **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, and segmentation protect the network from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
- **Compliance**: Regular audits, reporting, and monitoring ensure adherence to industry standards and legal requirements.

### 5.4.2 Zero Trust Architecture
```mermaid

    A[Identity Verification] --> B[Device Trust]
    B --> C[Access Control]
    C --> D[Data Protection]
    D --> E[Monitoring]
    end
```

Zero Trust Architecture enhances security by verifying every access request, regardless of its origin. This approach minimizes the risk of data breaches and ensures that systems remain secure even in dynamic environments.

## 5.5 Integration Architecture

### 5.5.1 API Management
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Rate Limiting]
    B --> C[Authentication]
    C --> D[Authorization]
    D --> E[Backend Services]
```

API management ensures seamless integration between systems by providing a centralized platform for managing APIs. Key features include rate limiting to prevent overuse, authentication and authorization for secure access, and backend services for data processing.

### 5.5.2 Event Architecture
```mermaid

    end
```

Event architecture enables real-time data processing and communication between systems. This approach is particularly useful for handling high-frequency events, such as flight status updates and sensor readings.

## 5.6 Monitoring and Observability

### 5.6.1 Monitoring Framework
```mermaid
