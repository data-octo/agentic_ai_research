# Chapter 5: Data Fabric and Data Mesh for Airlines

## The Need for New Architectural Paradigms

Traditional approaches to enterprise data architecture have proven insufficient for the scale, complexity, and dynamism of modern airline operations. Centralized data warehouses and monolithic data lakes often become bottlenecks to innovation, struggling with:

- **Scale**: The sheer volume of airline data exceeds what centralized teams can effectively manage
- **Agility**: Business needs evolve faster than centralized data teams can respond
- **Complexity**: Domain-specific knowledge is difficult to centralize effectively
- **Integration**: Point-to-point integrations become unmanageable at enterprise scale
- **Governance**: Balancing control with innovation becomes increasingly difficult

Two architectural paradigms have emerged as particularly promising for addressing these challenges: Data Mesh and Data Fabric. While often discussed as competing approaches, they are best understood as complementary patterns that address different aspects of the modern data challengeâ€”organizational and technical, respectively.

## Data Mesh: Domain-Oriented Data Ownership

Data Mesh, a concept introduced by Zhamak Dehghani, represents a sociotechnical approach to data architecture. It shifts from centralized data ownership to a distributed model where domain teams take responsibility for their data as products.

### Core Principles of Data Mesh

The Data Mesh approach is built on four fundamental principles:

#### 1. Domain-Oriented Ownership
Data ownership and processing are aligned with business domains rather than centralized in a single team. In the airline context, this means:

- The Flight Operations domain owns all data related to aircraft movements
- The Customer Experience domain owns passenger journey data
- The Maintenance domain owns aircraft health and maintenance data
- The Revenue Management domain owns pricing and inventory data

Each domain is responsible for:
- Data quality and integrity
- Data transformations and processing
- Access controls and policies
- Service level agreements

#### 2. Data as a Product
Each domain treats its data as a product designed to serve consumers across the organization:

- Clear documentation and semantic definitions
- Consistent interfaces and access patterns
- Quality guarantees and monitoring
- Versioning and change management
- Performance and availability SLAs

#### 3. Self-Service Data Infrastructure
Domain teams need standardized infrastructure that enables autonomy without reinventing the wheel:

- Reusable templates and patterns
- Automated provisioning and deployment
- Monitoring and observability tools
- Security and compliance guardrails
- Development and test environments

#### 4. Federated Computational Governance
Governance shifts from centralized control to federated standards:

- Shared principles and policies
- Common metadata and discovery mechanisms
- Interoperability standards
- Cross-domain data contracts
- Organizational incentives for sharing

### Data Mesh in the Airline Context

Applying Data Mesh principles to an airline organization might look like this:

    CX_PROFILE --> RM_FCST
    FO_PRED --> MX_PLAN
    RM_OPT --> FO_RAW
```

#### Domain Data Products in Airlines

Each domain creates data products that serve both internal needs and cross-domain consumers:

**Flight Operations Domain Products:**
