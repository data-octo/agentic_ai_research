## Case Study: GlobalAir's Integrated Operations Center

GlobalAir's transformation culminated in the development of an AI-powered Integrated Operations Center (IOC) that demonstrates the convergence of agentic AI across multiple domains. This case study illustrates how the enterprise data architecture framework enables coordinated action across traditionally siloed systems.

### Operational Scenario: Major Weather Disruption

When a hurricane threatened GlobalAir's East Coast hub, the agentic AI ecosystem orchestrated a coordinated response:

1. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Weather monitoring agents detected the approaching hurricane 5 days in advance
   - Flight impact prediction agents modeled potential disruption scenarios
   - Customer impact assessment agents identified affected passengers and priorities

2. **Coordinated Planning:**
   - Fleet repositioning agents developed aircraft evacuation plans
   - Schedule optimization agents created revised flight plans
   - Crew reassignment agents rerouted flight crews while ensuring duty time compliance
   - Maintenance agents rescheduled planned work to accommodate the disruption

3. **Customer Experience Management:**
   - Proactive rebooking agents automatically rerouted high-value customers
   - Communication agents sent personalized notifications with options
   - Service recovery agents allocated compensation based on customer value and impact
   - Airport experience agents optimized staffing at alternative arrival airports

4. **Financial Optimization:**
   - Revenue protection agents prioritized rebooking to minimize revenue loss
   - Cost management agents optimized accommodation and transportation expenses
   - Cash flow agents adjusted forecasts and payment schedules
   - Insurance agents initiated appropriate claims processes

The coordinated response resulted in:
- 78% reduction in customer complaints compared to previous similar disruptions
- 42% decrease in accommodation costs through optimized passenger rerouting
- 23% improvement in crew utilization during recovery operations
- 3-day faster return to normal operations compared to historical averages

## Key Takeaways
